🎤 Speech Emotion Recognition System (SER)
📌 Project Overview

The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) System is a machine learning–based application that analyzes human speech audio and predicts the emotion expressed in the voice.
The system takes a .wav audio file as input, extracts acoustic features, and classifies the emotion using a trained machine learning model.

This project demonstrates the practical application of audio signal processing, machine learning, and web-based user interaction.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze speech signals and extract meaningful acoustic features

To train a machine learning model for emotion classification

To predict emotions from unseen speech audio files

To provide a simple and intuitive web-based interface for users

🧠 Emotions Recognized

The system can classify speech into emotion categories such as:

Angry

Happy

Sad

Neutral

Fear

Disgust

Surprise

(Emotion labels depend on the dataset used)

🗂️ Dataset Used

TESS – Toronto Emotional Speech Set

Contains emotional speech samples spoken by female speakers

Preprocessed into a CSV file with handcrafted acoustic features

File used:

📊 Model Performance

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Training Accuracy: 0.9875

Evaluation Method: Train–Test Split

🎓 Academic Justification

“The system extracts acoustic features from speech audio and uses a supervised machine learning classifier to predict emotions. Metadata columns were removed during preprocessing, and only numeric acoustic features were used for training.”

🔮 Future Enhancements

Real-time microphone recording

Support for more datasets

Deep learning models (CNN / LSTM)

Emotion visualization graphs

Cloud deployment

✅ Conclusion

The Speech Emotion Recognition System successfully demonstrates how machine learning and audio processing techniques can be applied to identify emotions from human speech.
The project achieves accurate emotion classification and provides an easy-to-use web interface, making it suitable for academic demonstrations and real-world extensions.
